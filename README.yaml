# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to define a consistent Hashicorp Cloud Platform Hashicorp Virtual Network peering connection with your AWS VPC.

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  # Create a standard label resource. See [null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/#terraform-null-label--)
  module "label" {
    source  = "cloudposse/label/null"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version, though usually you want to use the current one
    # version = "x.x.x"

    namespace = "eg"
    name      = "example"
  }

  data "aws_vpc" "default" {
    default = true
  }

  module "hcp_hvn" {
    source  = "ugns/hcp-hvn/aws"
    # version = "x.x.x"

    hvn_region = "us-east-1"

    context = module.label.this
  }
 
   module "example" {
    source  = "ugns/hcp-hvn-peering-connection/aws"
    # version = "x.x.x"

    hcp_hvn_id = module.hcp_hvn.hcp_hvn_id
    peer_vpc_id = data.aws_vpc.default.id

    context = module.label.this
  }
  ```
